#### Create your own custom Backbone Model to model stack information.
- In addition to an id, make sure each StackModel has a title, instructor, and language
- Whenever a new model is created, set the instructor to be Michael Choi (hint: use keyword this)
- Create two new stacks from your model and set their titles and languages
- Verify your stacks are created properly using a browser console or NodeJS
