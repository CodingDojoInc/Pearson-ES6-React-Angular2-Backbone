#### Use the following tips
- Create your models using this information for a few of the Premier League's team names, nicknames, and years founded:
  - Leicester City, The Foxes, 1884
  - Arsenal, The Gunners, 1886
  - Manchester United, The Red Devils, 1878
  - Everton, The Toffees, 1878
  - Tottenham Hotspur, Spurs, 1882
- Break your views into three pieces. One to represent your models, one to represent the collection, and one to represent your team history output. Initially, the team history box will be empty.
- Focus on what `this` is referring to throughout the views, models, and collections.
- Think about what views are going to be calling or rendering other views and WHEN (think of events)
- Research how to incorporate attributes like id and className into your Backbone View here: http://backbonejs.org/#View-extend
